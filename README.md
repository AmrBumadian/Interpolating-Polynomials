# Interpolating Polynomials
this code takes set of points as input, then transforms the augmented matrix formed from those points using **Guass's Elimination** to **Echolen Form**, then solves the system of linear equations and finally outputs the coefficients of the polynomial equation whose curve passes through the input points.
